# Python Operators - Assignment (Class 02 - March 03)

This repository contains simple and easy-to-understand Python examples for different types of operators in Python. Each operator is demonstrated with clear code examples and explanations.

## 🔹 **Operators Covered**
### 1️⃣ **Arithmetic Operators**
Used for basic mathematical operations.
- `+` (Addition)  
- `-` (Subtraction)  
- `*` (Multiplication)  
- `/` (Division)  
- `%` (Modulus)  
- `**` (Exponentiation)  
- `//` (Floor Division)  

### 2️⃣ **Assignment Operators**
Used to assign values to variables with shorthand operations.
- `=` (Assign value)  
- `+=` (Add and assign)  
- `-=` (Subtract and assign)  
- `*=` (Multiply and assign)  
- `/=` (Divide and assign)  

### 3️⃣ **Comparison Operators**
Used to compare values and return a boolean result (`True` or `False`).
- `==` (Equal to)  
- `!=` (Not equal to)  
- `>` (Greater than)  
- `<` (Less than)  
- `>=` (Greater than or equal to)  
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)  

### 4️⃣ **Logical Operators**
Used to combine conditional statements.
- `and` (Both conditions must be `True`)  
- `or` (At least one condition is `True`)  
- `not` (Reverses the condition)  

### 5️⃣ **Identity Operators**
Used to compare memory locations of two objects.
- `is` (Returns `True` if both objects are the same)  
- `is not` (Returns `True` if both objects are different)  

### 6️⃣ **Membership Operators**
Used to check if a value is present in a sequence.
- `in` (Returns `True` if value exists in sequence)  
- `not in` (Returns `True` if value does not exist in sequence)  

### 7️⃣ **Bitwise Operators**
Used for bit-level operations.
- `&` (Bitwise AND)  
- `|` (Bitwise OR)  
- `^` (Bitwise XOR)  
- `~` (Bitwise NOT)  
- `<<` (Left shift)  
- `>>` (Right shift)
